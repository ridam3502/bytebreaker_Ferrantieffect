### About the Experiment 

The **Ferranti Effect** is a phenomenon that occurs in long, high-voltage AC transmission lines, where the voltage at the receiving end becomes higher than the voltage at the sending end, especially when the line is lightly loaded or open-circuited. This happens due to the distributed capacitance of the line, which causes a leading charging current even when there is little or no load. The interaction between the lineâ€™s inductance and capacitance can result in a voltage rise at the far end of the line. The effect becomes more significant as the line length and operating voltage increase, and it is typically noticeable in transmission lines longer than 200 kilometers. This can lead to overvoltage conditions, potentially damaging equipment at the receiving end, and often requires the use of voltage regulation devices such as shunt reactors. The Ferranti Effect is named after Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, who first observed and analyzed this behavior in the early days of electrical power systems.
