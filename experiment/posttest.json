        "a": "Receiving end voltage is less than sending end voltage.",
        "b": "Receiving end voltage is greater than sending end voltage.",
        "c": "Sending end current is greater than receiving end current.",
        "d": "Power factor becomes leading at the sending end."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – this is a typical voltage drop.",
        "b": "Correct – this defines the Ferranti Effect.",
        "c": "Incorrect – current relation is different.",
        "d": "Incorrect – power factor can be leading but doesn't define the effect.",

      "question": "Which device is commonly used to mitigate the Ferranti Effect?",

        "a": "Series Capacitor",
        "b": "Shunt Reactor",
        "c": "Tap Changing Transformer",

      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – series capacitors can worsen it.",
        "b": "Correct – shunt reactors absorb leading reactive power.",
        "c": "Incorrect – used for voltage regulation under load.",
        "d": "Incorrect – resistors cause voltage drop, not suitable for this problem.",
