        "a": "Series Inductance",
        "b": "Shunt Capacitance",
        "c": "Series Resistance",
        "d": "Shunt Conductance"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – inductance draws lagging current.",
        "b": "Correct – capacitance draws leading current.",
        "c": "Incorrect – resistance is resistive.",
        "d": "Incorrect – conductance is resistive."

      "question": "What type of load condition is most likely to exhibit the Ferranti Effect?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Heavy inductive load",
        "b": "Heavy capacitive load",
        "c": "No-load or light load",
        "d": "Unity power factor load"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect – heavy inductive loads cause voltage drop.",
        "b": "Incorrect – heavy capacitive loads can also cause voltage rise but Ferranti is specific to no-load.",
        "c": "Correct – the effect is prominent under no-load or light load conditions.",
        "d": "Incorrect – unity power factor load doesn't typically cause this effect.",
