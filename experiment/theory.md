🧭 1. Introduction
The Ferranti Effect is a phenomenon in power transmission where the voltage at the receiving end of a long transmission line is higher than the sending end voltage, particularly under no-load or light-load condition
📌 Where It Occurs:
*Long transmission lines (typically >150 km)
*Light or no load at the receiving end
*High voltage AC systems (50Hz or 60Hz) 

2.🔍 What Causes the Ferranti Effect?
The Ferranti Effect occurs due to the line capacitance and inductive reactance of transmission lines.

*Capacitive charging current flows along the line even when the load is absent.

*This current leads to a leading voltage drop across the line inductance.

*The voltage adds up toward the receiving end due to this reactive effect.
This leading charging current and the lagging line inductance create a situation where :-Vs<Vr
where
       Vr = Receving end voltage
       Vs= send end voltage
  🧮 4. Mathematical Derivation of Ferranti Effect
Let:​
Vs  = Sending end voltage
​Vr= Receiving end voltage
L = Total line inductance
C = Total line capacitance
ω=2πf = Angular frequency (rad/s)
