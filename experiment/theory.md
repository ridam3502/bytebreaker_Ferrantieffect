🧭 1. Introduction
The Ferranti Effect is a phenomenon in power transmission where the voltage at the receiving end of a long transmission line is higher than the sending end voltage, particularly under no-load or light-load condition
📌 Where It Occurs:
*Long transmission lines (typically >150 km)
*Light or no load at the receiving end
*High voltage AC systems (50Hz or 60Hz) 

2.🔍 What Causes the Ferranti Effect?
The Ferranti Effect occurs due to the line capacitance and inductive reactance of transmission lines.

*Capacitive charging current flows along the line even when the load is absent.

*This current leads to a leading voltage drop across the line inductance.

*The voltage adds up toward the receiving end due to this reactive effect.
This leading charging current and the lagging line inductance create a situation where :-Vs<Vr
where
       Vr = Receving end voltage
       Vs= send end voltage

4.🧮 Mathematical Derivation of Ferranti Effect
Let:​
Vs  = Sending end voltage
​Vr= Receiving end voltage
L = Total line inductance
C = Total line capacitance
ω=2πf = Angular frequency (rad/s

Under no-load condition, the receiving-end voltage becomes:

Vr ≈ Vs × (1 + (ω² × L × C) / 2)
Or equivalently, the percentage voltage rise is:
(Vr-Vs) / Vs=(ω² × L × C) / 2

This formula shows that Vr > Vs when the line has significant inductance and capacitance under light or no load. 

5.🛠️ How to Minimize Ferranti Effect

*Connect reactive loads (inductive) at the receiving end.

*Use shunt reactors to absorb excess reactive power.

*Reduce line charging current using series capacitors (not common).

*Load the line—the effect is negligible under full load conditions.

6.📈Effect Observation

*Voltage rises gradually along the line from sending to receiving end.

*More pronounced in underground cables due to high capacitance.

*Increased overvoltage stress at the receiving end.

7.📌 Key Observations

*The longer the line, the greater the Ferranti Effect.

*The higher the line voltage and frequency, the stronger the effect.

*It's more serious in underground cables (higher C) than in overhead lines.

8.✅ Conclusion

The Ferranti Effect is a vital consideration in high-voltage long-distance AC power transmission, especially during light-load or no-load operation. It arises due to the interplay between the line capacitance and inductance, causing the receiving end voltage to exceed the sending end voltage.

*This overvoltage can cause:

*Stress on insulation

*Equipment failure

*Malfunction of protection systems
