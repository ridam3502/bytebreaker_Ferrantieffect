1. Introduction
The Ferranti Effect is a phenomenon observed in long transmission lines where the receiving end voltage (V 
R
​
 ) becomes greater than the sending end voltage (V 
S
​
 ) under light load or no-load conditions. This occurs due to the charging current flowing through the line's shunt capacitance, which leads to a voltage drop across the line's series inductance in phase opposition to the sending end voltage.

2. Causes of Ferranti Effect
The primary causes of the Ferranti Effect are:

Shunt Capacitance (C): Long transmission lines have significant shunt capacitance distributed along their length. Under light load or no-load conditions, this capacitance draws a leading charging current.

Series Inductance (L): The transmission line also possesses series inductance. The leading charging current flowing through this inductance produces a voltage drop (I 
C
​
 ⋅X 
L
​
 ) that is in phase with the sending end voltage, effectively adding to it at the receiving end.

The effect is more pronounced in:

Long transmission lines (due to higher total capacitance).

High voltage transmission lines (due to higher charging current).

Lightly loaded or no-load conditions.

3. Mathematical Modeling
Consider a long transmission line. For simplicity, we can use a nominal π (Pi) model or a nominal T model for analysis.

Using Nominal π Model:
Let:

V 
S
​
  = Sending end voltage

V 
R
​
  = Receiving end voltage

I 
S
​
  = Sending end current

I 
R
​
  = Receiving end current

Z=R+jX 
L
​
  = Total series impedance of the line

Y=jB 
C
​
  = Total shunt admittance of the line (where B 
C
​
 =ωC)

At no-load (I 
R
​
 =0):

The current through the second shunt capacitance at the receiving end is zero. The current flowing through the series impedance Z is the charging current I 
C
​
 .

The voltage at the receiving end can be approximated as:


V 
R
​
 =V 
S
​
 −I 
C
​
 ⋅Z

Since I 
C
​
  is a leading current and Z has an inductive component, the voltage drop I 
C
​
 ⋅Z will be in phase with V 
S
​
 , leading to V 
R
​
 >V 
S
​
 .

A more precise relationship for a long line can be derived using ABCD parameters:


V 
R
​
 =AV 
S
​
 −BI 
S
​
 

Under no-load, I 
R
​
 =0. The relationship between sending and receiving end voltages and currents for a long line is given by:


V 
S
​
 =AV 
R
​
 +BI 
R
​
 
I 
S
​
 =CV 
R
​
 +DI 
R
​
 

At no-load, I 
R
​
 =0, so:


V 
S
​
 =AV 
R
​
 
I 
S
​
 =CV 
R
​
 

Therefore,


V 
R
​
 = 
A
V 
S
​
 
​
 

For a long transmission line, the parameter A is given by A=cosh(γl), where γ= 
ZY
​
  is the propagation constant and l is the length of the line. For lossless lines, A=cos(βl), where β is the phase constant.
Since cos(βl) is typically less than 1 for practical line lengths where Ferranti effect is observed (e.g., βl<π/2), V 
R
​
  becomes greater than V 
S
​
 .

4. Phasor Diagram (No-load)
Under no-load conditions, the receiving end current I 
R
​
 =0. The current flowing through the line is primarily the charging current (I 
C
​
 ) due to shunt capacitance.

Take V 
R
​
  as the reference phasor.

The charging current I 
C
​
  leads V 
R
​
  by 90 
∘
 .

The voltage drop across the line inductance is I 
C
​
 X 
L
​
 , which leads I 
C
​
  by 90 
∘
 . Therefore, I 
C
​
 X 
L
​
  is in phase with V 
R
​
 .

The voltage drop across the line resistance is I 
C
​
 R, which is in phase with I 
C
​
 .

The sending end voltage V 
S
​
  is the phasor sum of V 
R
​
 , I 
C
​
 R, and I 
C
​
 X 
L
​
 .

Due to the inductive voltage drop I 
C
​
 X 
L
​
  being in phase with V 
R
​
 , V 
S
​
  can be smaller than V 
R
​
 .

5. Implications and Mitigation
Implications:

Overvoltage: The increased voltage at the receiving end can stress insulation, potentially leading to equipment damage or flashovers.

Protection Issues: It can cause maloperation of protective relays.

Voltage Regulation: Poor voltage regulation.

Mitigation Methods:

Shunt Reactors: Connecting shunt reactors (inductors) in parallel with the transmission line at the receiving end. These reactors draw lagging reactive power, compensating for the leading reactive power generated by the line's shunt capacitance, thereby absorbing the excess voltage.

Synchronous Condensers: Synchronous condensers can be used to absorb reactive power, thus controlling the voltage.

Series Capacitors: While series capacitors improve voltage regulation under load, they can exacerbate the Ferranti effect under light load. They are generally not used for Ferranti effect mitigation.

6. Conclusion
The Ferranti Effect is an important consideration in the design and operation of long EHV/UHV transmission lines. Understanding its causes and applying appropriate mitigation techniques, primarily shunt reactors, is crucial for maintaining voltage stability and ensuring reliable power delivery.
