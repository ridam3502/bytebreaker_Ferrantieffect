### Aim of the experiment

To study the Ferranti Effect in long transmission lines, observe the phenomenon of receiving end voltage being greater than the sending end voltage under light load or no-load conditions, and analyze the factors influencing its magnitude. This experiment aims to visualize the voltage rise and understand its implications for power system operation and control.
