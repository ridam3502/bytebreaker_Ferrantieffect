Procedure
Open the Simulation: Launch the virtual simulator for the Ferranti Effect experiment.

Select Line Length: Choose the length of the transmission line (e.g., 200 km, 300 km, 400 km).

Set Sending End Voltage (V 
S
​
 ): Input the desired sending end voltage.

Set Line Parameters: Adjust the per-unit length series resistance (R), series inductance (L), and shunt capacitance (C) of the transmission line.

Set Load Conditions:

For observing Ferranti Effect, set the load to "No Load" or "Light Load".

Optionally, vary the load to see its impact on the receiving end voltage.

Run Simulation: Start the simulation to observe the sending and receiving end voltages.

Observe Output: The simulator displays:

The sending end voltage (V 
S
​
 ).

The receiving end voltage (V 
R
​
 ).

A phasor diagram illustrating the voltage and current relationships.

Optionally, the charging current and reactive power.

Calculate Voltage Rise Percentage:


\text{Voltage Rise (%)} = \left( \frac{V_R - V_S}{V_S} \right) \times 100
Repeat with Different Parameters:

Change line length to see its effect.

Vary shunt capacitance or series inductance to understand their impact.

Introduce a shunt reactor (if simulated) and observe its effect on V 
R
​
 .

Analyze Results: Note how the Ferranti Effect changes with varying line parameters and load conditions, and how mitigation techniques affect the receiving end voltage.
